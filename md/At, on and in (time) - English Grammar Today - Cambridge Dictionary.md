We use _at_:

*   with particular points in the day:

> _What are you doing at the weekend?_

*   with special celebrations:

We use _on_:

*   with dates:
    

> _We moved into this house on 25 October 1987._

> _I’ve got to go to London on Friday._

> _The office is closed on Fridays._ (every Friday) In informal situations, we often leave out _on_ before plural days:

> _Do you work Saturdays?_

*   with special dates:
    

> _What do you normally do on your birthday?_

We use _in_:

*   with parts of the day:
    

> _I’ll come and see you in the morning for a cup of coffee, okay?_

*   with months:
    

> _We usually go camping in July or August._

*   with years:

### _At_ or _on_?

We use _at_ to talk about public holidays and weekends, but when we talk about a particular special day or weekend, we use _on_.

Compare

| 

> _We never go away at the New Year because the traffic is awful._

 | 

> _On New Year’s Day, the whole family gets together._

 |
| 

> _I’ll go and see my mother at the weekend if the weather’s okay._

 | 

> _The folk festival is always held on the last weekend in July._

 |

\*Note that American English speakers usually say _on the weekend_.

### _In_ or _on_?

We use _in_ with _morning, afternoon, evening_ and _night_, but we use _on_ when we talk about a specific morning, afternoon, etc., or when we describe the part of the day.

Compare

| 

> _I always work best in the morning. I often get tired in the afternoon._

 | 

> _The ship left the harbour on the morning of the ninth of November._

 |
| 

> _In the evening they used to sit outside and watch the sun going down._

 | 

> _It happened on a beautiful summer’s evening._

 |

### _At_ or _in_?

_In the night_ usually refers to one particular night; _at night_ refers to any night in general:

> _I was awake in the night, thinking about all the things that have happened._

> _‘It’s not safe to travel at night,’ the officer said._

### _At the end_ or _in the end_?

We use _at the end_ (often with _of_) to talk about the point in time where something finishes. We use _in the end_ to talk about things that happen after a long time or after a series of other events:

> _At the end of the film, everyone was crying._

> Not: In the end of the film …

> _I looked everywhere for the book but couldn’t find it, so in the end I bought a new copy._

### _At the beginning_ or _in the beginning_?

We use _at the beginning_ (often with _of_) to talk about the point where something starts. We usually use _in the beginning_ when we contrast two situations in time:

> _At the beginning of every lesson, the teacher told the children a little story._

> _In the beginning, nobody understood what was happening, but after she explained everything very carefully, things were much clearer._

Other uses of _in_ with time
----------------------------

We use _in_ to say how long it takes someone to do something:

> _He was such a clever musician. He could learn a song in about five minutes._

We use an apostrophe _\-s_ construction (_in a year’s time, in two months’ time_) to say when something will happen. We don’t use it to say how long someone takes to do something:

> _I won’t say goodbye because we’ll be seeing each other again in three days’ time. We can also say in three days, without time, in this example._

> _He ran the marathon in six hours and 20 minutes._

> Not: He ran the marathon in six hours and 20 minutes’ time.

Time expressions without _at, on, in_
-------------------------------------

We don’t normally use _at, on_ or _in_ before time expressions beginning with _each_, _every_, _next, last, some, this, that, one, any, all_:

> _He plays football every Saturday._

> _Are you free next Monday at two o’clock?_

> _Last summer we rented a villa in Portugal._

_At_, _on_ and _in_ (time): typical errors
------------------------------------------

*   We use _on_ not _at_ to talk about a particular day:
    

> _The two couples were married in two different cities on the same day, 25 years ago._

> Not: … at the same day, 25 years ago.

*   We don’t use _at_ to refer to dates:
    

> _The General was killed on 26 August._

> Not: … at 26 August.

*   We use _at_, not _in_, with _weekend(s_):
    

> _What do you usually do at the weekend? Do you go away?_

> Not: What do you usually do in the weekend?

*   We use _in_ with months, not _on_:
    

> _They’re going to Australia in September for a conference._

> Not: They’re going to Australia on September …
